# selfPass
A Self Hosted Password Management tool.

I have seen that many of the available password management tools either create local files, or they are services.
Services are always in danger of changing, and becoming unusable, but they provide the benefit of always available access to
passwords.

This is an attempt to bring more control to centralized password management.
